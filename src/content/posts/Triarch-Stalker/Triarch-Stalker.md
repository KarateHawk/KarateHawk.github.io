# Triarch Stalker

I'm in a bit of a 40k kick right now, so you're getting a second article in a row. Don't roll your eyes and sign at me, this is my blog! We go as long as I say! :D
Last week I took a look at how the Annihilation Legion could be improved. This week, I want to reign it in a little and just take a look at one of the most confused datasheets in the Necron range: the Triarch Stalker.

## The Datasheet

I'd wager that a fair number of non-Necron players haven't ever seen this unit on the tabletop. The Triarch Stalker is a 110-pt. vehicle. It's this big ol' spider lookin' thing with a Praetorian hitched on its back. It's T8, got 12 wounds, and a 3+/4++. That's a pretty chunky profile for its cost. While a standard melta profile should be the perfect counter to other vehicles of its type, the 4++ is super annoying for your opponent. Just make one too many saves, and your stalker gets to hold primary.

Speaking of primary, this thing is a whopping OC4 and moves 8" while also packing Scout 8". It's also got a weirdly good profile at 4 attacks hitting on 3's, S7 ap1 D3, meaning if it ever gets its hands on some elite infantry any failed save equals death to that model. With all this in mind, this little guys seems like a pretty good early trade unit - one you throw at your opponent's natural expansion to steal the point for a turn before being blasted away.

:::note[Targeting Relay]
In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the end of the phase, that unit cannot have the Benefit of Cover.
:::

It's kinda funny? I guess? Here's the problem: most Necron guns have one more ap than other equivalent units across the game. It's one of our gimmicks next to reanimation protocols. DDA's, Gauss LHD's, and Monolith's are all ap4, Doomstalkers are ap3, and even something as tiny as our humble Necron Warrior has ap1 on their reapers. This isn't to say also getting to ignore cover on our guns isn't without merit, but all our guns kinda already have ignores cover with their extra pip in ap.

I think the major problem is that the stalker is trying to do too many things and fails to pick what its role is on the tabletop.

## Where Does This Model Belong?

You would think the stalker would have a home in Obeisance Phalanx, and you'd be wrong. Kinda sorta? It's complicated.

Does the Triarch Stalker have the Triarch keyword? Yes. Does it get to benefit from the +1 to wound against the oathed target? Yeah, sure. Does it matter? No. Why am I talking to myself?

Listen, getting +1 to wound is - in theory - a good buff. But when the stalker taps out at 2 shots with s9? That hit on 3's and are probably shooting something with an invulnerable save? It doesn't really help all that much.

The strats aren't much of a help either. Of the six in the detachment, 4 can be used on the stalker, and those grant it:

- Precision on its melee attacks
- -1 damage for a phase
- Crits on 5+'s in the shooting or fight phase
- +3 OC at the start of your command phase

Eh? The cheekiest of the bunch is the extra OC strat, letting you bump the stalker up to OC7 and potentially flip a point before you score it, but it's also something your opponent will know you can do and either make sure they put 8OC on the point before they pass their turn, or spend more resources to kill your stalker entirely.

-1 damage is also not the worst thing in the world but would be better spent on something like The Silent King or a DDA. You don't play a Triarch Stalker as an invincible vehicle, it's a dinky little T8 buggy that you trade for a primary point in the early game.

The others are just memes. Precision on their weird melee? Pass. Fishing for lethal hits with its Gauss option? You're high.

So what do we do here? Other than fixing Obeisance Phalanx entirely - 'cause that's another long article I don't got the time for this week.

## The Fantasy of the Stalker

Before we go much further into what should change, it's important to first understand what the fantasy of a Triarch Stalker is. What is its purpose on the battlefield. If we understand what the fantasy is, we can make rules that reinforce what this model is all about.

Heading over to the Triarch Stalker's page on the official Warhammer site, here's what is has to say:

:::important[Triarch Stalker Description]
Like an enormous mechanical spider, a Triarch Stalker looms over the battlefield with its multiple slicing limbs and devastating weaponry controlled by a high-ranking Triarch Praetorian. When a Triarch Stalker advances, it does so with a speed and surety that belies its jerking gait. Indeed, it can cover all manner of terrain with a deftness and precision seldom found in the walkers of less advanced races. While the Triarch Stalker can mount a wide array of anti-infantry and anti-armour weaponry, it is most commonly employed as a dedicated tank-hunter. They can easily outmanoeuvre more cumbersome tracked vehicles, the better to unleash their withering firepower against the thinner armour presented by the target's flanks and rear.

Your Triarch Stalkers can often be found at the head of your Necron assault, scuttling in front of your legion to tackle those particularly stubborn foes. Like all Necron commanders, you will have factored in a requirement for destroying tanks, and the Triarch Stalker's focussed heat ray will do the job nicely. Once you run out of tanks to destroy, you can then set to work on wiping out any infantry.
:::

Huh. Interesting, no? This description seems to be describing a totally different unit, because the current iteration of the stalker's got none of these cool abilities. James Workshop calls this unit a 'dedicated tank hunter' who 'advances with a speed and surety that belies its jerking gait.'

I mean, there's a little bit of that in the current datasheet. Moving 8" with Scout 8" is really speedy for a vehicle of its size. Those numbers do play into the idea that this is an early assault weapon whose purpose is to scout ahead of the main force, but this doesn't pan out on the tabletop.

For one, the stalker is a big boy. The model is comfortably 150mm around, but because it's a vehicle without a base, it needs to pay the -2" tax anytime that it wishes to pivot when moving. It also cannot move through walls, which makes getting this phat boi up the table a bigger effort than its stats would have you believe.

For second, anti-tank? The particle shredder is strength 7, the heavy gauss array s8, and the heat ray mentioned in the description is only a measly strength 9. For context, the cutoff for most vehicles is T9. This is where your rhinos and other transport equivalents live. Any other proper tanks tend to live in the T10-12 range, so with the stalker's best profile, you're wounding tanks on 4's at best but usually wounding on 5's. A terrible option for killing tanks.

This is why the model has found a home in starshatter over Phalanx, mainly because it gets all the movement it could desire. Because the stalker is a vehicle, in starshatter all of its guns gain assault, it can flat advance 6", it can move through walls, reactive move d6 after it gets shot, and can gain either +1 to wound or subtract 1 to wound against incoming damage. Now the model is a zippy as the description we read, which is awesome!

## The Fixes

So what's the fix? My first instinct was to try to improve the profiles of its guns. If this is to be an anti-tank buggy, let's give it the guns it needs to fit that description. But I quickly came up against the issue that this thing is already pretty good in starshatter. If its guns become any better AND get to benefit from the laundry list of buffs starshatter grants to shooting vehicles, well that would be double dipping, and not what I'm looking for.

So I went back to the drawing board. I sat down and pulled all of my units that have keywords that fit into an Obeisance Phalanx and set them down on the table before me. I wanted to see what this section of the army was lacking, and how the stalker could be buffed to improve only this army section. We got Lychguard, Praetorians, warriors and immortals lead by an overlord, and The Silent King. Lots of very slow infantry, one speedy deepstrike unit, and the king of aura himself.

This section of the army is very resilient but doesn't deal any meaningful damage to targets over toughness 5. Doesn't help that range also lacks long range guns. This tells me that if you were to face off against a all-tanks guard list or suited-up T'au army, you'd just get blasted off the board and never get a chance to touch their backline tanks. And that's where I got a delightfully devilish idea. Two, in fact.

Well, for one, I think its ability has got to go. Ignoring cover just isn't the best buff for Necrons, and it's not a very unique benefit to provide the army. Anything that's a big gun is already ap'ed out of their gords, and warriors and immortals would rather have Illuminor Szeras nearby. The stalker provides a conditional extra ap against one unit it shot at this turn. Illuminor provides not only +1 ap to all battleline units regardless of target, but also subtracts 1 ap from all incoming attacks. Simply outclassed. So here's my suggested ability change.

:::note[Scuttling Construct]
Each time this model makes a Normal, Advance, Fallback or Charge move, it can move horizontally through terrain features.
:::

This model is meant to be a fast-moving ATV. It even says in the description that it can go wherever he pleases because he got them long-ass legs. This also helps the stalker out in Obeisance Phalanx because the biggest drawback to that section of the army is speed. Now this buggy is guaranteed to move where he wants across the board, get where he needs, and can melee the shit outta any vehicle he wants.

'Wait, melee?' I hear you thinking, 'But the stalker is only s7?' And this is where my second idea comes in. Give his melee anti-monster and anti-vehicle 3+.

As my mind was drifting the other night on how I could do more than just letting the stalker do what it already does in starshatter, a thought occurred. You can't advance and charge in starshatter, so if the stalker had better melee? It wouldn't cascade into starshatter as heavily and would be a pretty decent buff to its flat 3 damage attacks. It also would give the stalker a unique role in the Necron range as a 'Hey Shitass' missel. Huck this bug across the board and tangle up the gunline while your foot soldiers hoof it to the center.

It also fits the description we read earlier. The stalker can outmaneuver slower tanks and monsters, flanking them and pouncing on their rears and weak points.

And there we go! The ways in which I would change the stalker to not just be a cheap vehicle body. Instead, it now has a proper role in the section of the army its name is based on. With these changes I could see a need for raising its points by 10-15, but that may require more cycles of testing on the tabletop to see if it's strictly needed.
