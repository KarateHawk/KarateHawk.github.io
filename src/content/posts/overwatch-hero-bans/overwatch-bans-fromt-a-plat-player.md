# Hero Bans Are Here, But is the Game Better For It?

I love Overwatch. It’s not just my favorite FPS, but also my straight-up favorite competitive game.

For anyone who’s been playing as much as I have, you may already know that Overwatch received a huge patch in April that has truly changed the fundamental structure of the game. Not only did they add a brand-new game-within-the-game in the stadium mode, but Blizzard also finally implemented a hero ban system in comp.

Thank fuck. Took Blizzard 9 years to get here, but hero bans are finally here and look like they’re going to stay.

I love playing Winston. I love being a big ol’ ape jumping around the map like it’s my own personal jungle-gym. My love for him grew even more after Blizzard added hero perks because Winston’s chain lighting is one of the most fun abilities in the game for me. Watching an enemy Ana fall back behind a wall with a sliver of health thinking she’s safe, only for her to get chain-zapped by my gun because her tank was peaking makes me giggle like a schoolgirl anytime it happens. There is one big problem I have though.

If I play monke – Reaper will come out to play.

Every. Single. Time.

This counter swapping isn’t unique to just Winson though. Any D.Va or Sigma main will tell you that if they ever get on a roll and win one too many team fights, the enemy tank will be swapping to Zarya. Wanna play Rein? Oh look, it’s a Bastion and Mei. Maybe feelin’ like you want some Hog gameplay? You’re going to be purple at every critical push after the Ana switch.

In my experience climbing through plat, it’s where the last fumes of “5 separate 1v1’s” burns out. By this I mean - prior to ranking up to diamond, each team was made up of a ragtag group of players who each want to play their own game. Your Genji wants to farm his Twitch clips, your Mercy is practicing her super jumps and is prioritizing that over anything else, and you as the tank are following a cookie-cutter gameplan of trying to take every corner for yourself because you watched a YouTube video that explained the basic of taking space, and now you think you’ve mastered this technique (You’re no where even close there, bud).

In this game scenario, the tank is therefore the most powerful player on the team. With the switch from 6v6 to 5v5, the tanks nowadays have become raid bosses. They have tons of health, CC resistance, lots of ways to mitigate incoming damage, and tend to have ults that shape how team fights are won or lost. It then stands to reason that if both teams are acting in a “Everyone  do their own thing” mentality, it would be in your best interest to try to counter the enemy tank as best you can, because they are the most capable single target you’re facing.

This was my biggest gripe with Overwatch. It felt like most comp games would boil down to “Just counter the tank to win”. Questions over tactics, proper positioning, pushing to take space and so on would break down when Reaper can just stand still  near the choke and say “Nope. You can’t come her no more.”

In all fairness, I can’t blame people who counter swap. Hell, I’ve done it plenty of times. And in the metal ranks it is a perfectly sound strategy to counter the biggest and baddest enemy player, since the people playing in those ranks haven’t graduated into playing a truly team-focused game yet.

But now, things are different. Blizzard has tried to tamp down on the effectiveness of counter swapping in less direct ways. First it was reducing the amount of ult charge retained after swapping, then it was hiding what you swapped to for a couple seconds from the enemy team, then most recently setting you back on perk progression after a swap.

There was a moment when I was playing with one of my friend that crystalized this feeling for me. Whenever we play together, she’ll usually play support or dps and stays far away from the tank role, despite D.Va being her second most-played hero at 118 hours. I had asked her a few times why not bust her out and play a few rounds, and she’d usually deflect, saying it was too much pressure and bring up the fact that she hated having to deal with constant counter swaps to Zarya or Symmetra.

After hero bans came out, I suggested we hit the ladder again and have her try out tank because we could now ban her counters. About halfway through the Esperança match, we were on a tear, picking off supports left and right and rolling over the enemy team. After she secured yet another Ana kill, she said:
“Is this how you felt playing Winston now? This is awesome!”

Now, I have a unique position where I only benefit from hero bans. This is because I don’t tend to play hated heroes. I normally play monke and Ram, and out of the 50-ish games I played in comp, I think I only had 2 games where a character I play was off the table. This is in contrast to heroes like Sombra, Ball, Mercy, Zarya, or Doom, where at least one of those characters were banned in every single game I played. I can imagine the frustration these players may be feeling – like they don’t get to play the game they love every other match because the character they fell in love with is often banned.

I don’t subscribe to some of the sentiment that I’ve seen online about how “X-Character mains deserve being banned for playing character’s I hate.” I feel like people who think that way are upset about other things inside and outside the game and use insert hot-button character here as an escape from addressing holes in their own gameplay.

My greatest hope, however, is that after the dust settles and the ban-rates of character have normalized, this data can give the balancing team at Blizzard a clear look into which characters cause the most pain-point in play, and potentially find ways to rework them so that they are still fun to play and are fun to play against.

But either way, I’m having a blast playing the game again. I feel like I have greater control over my playing experience, that I get to tailor my games to play out the way I want, and that my matches get more interesting now that my opponents can’t just swap to a counter character and throw all the difficult decision-making onto me. And hey! I’ve finally broken out of metal-rank hell and climbed my tank rank all the way up to diamond for the first time ever. So that’s something to celebrate at the end of the day.
