# Annihilation Legion

Ever heard of it? If you’re not a Necron player, there’s a good chance you’ve never encountered this detachment in the wild before. Looking of the most recent Meta Monday (This being the 5/5/25 issue at time of writing), Annihilation legion doesn’t even have a mention in the Necron section because no one played it. 156 Necron games logged for the week, 0 for AL. It’s so comically bad and mismanaged that it’s relegated to being a troll choice. One you only choose if you’re a good player who can win your local tournament scene off raw skill and datasheet power alone.
But what makes it so bad? Simply put, this is the melee-focused killy detachment that has none of the melee tricks needed to be viable and is outshined in the killy department by all the other detachments. 

## What's the flavor of the detachment?

This detachment keys off units with the Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones models. This encompasses a grand total of 8 units: The Skorpekh Lord, the Lokhust Lord, Skorpekh Destroyers, Lokhust Destroyers, Heavy Lokhust Destroyers, Ophydian Destroyers, Hexmark Destroyers, and Flayed Ones.

That’s a pretty tight range, but hey, on the bright side every unit I just listed is absolutely goated at what they do. 
Skorpekh Destroyers plus a Lord are the most efficient MSU trade pieces Necron players have access to. 170 points buys you 12 s7 ap2 d2 attacks with lethal hits and once-per-game dev wounds that always reroll hits of 1 and fully reroll hits on the charge. On top of this you get the Lord’s 4 s10 ap3 d3 strike or 8 s6 ap1 d1 sweep and he provides the squad a mortal wounds on the charge ability. They move 8 inches too, so you can yeet this package at pretty much anything and be confident that you’re gonna break whatever they slam into.

Hexmark Destroyers are the best scoring piece in the game. For 75 points you get a single 40mm based character who can deep strike and has lone op. That alone makes his value undeniable, but on top of this, his gun is pretty meaty too at 6 attacks s6 ap2 d1 ignores cover and pistol. If all of this wasn’t good enough, he also has a shoot back ability AND he has the ability to overwatch – for free – even if you used it somewhere else this phase – and hits on 2’s while overwatching. And also also ALSO, he’s a character – which means he can hold enhancements. Popular choices include starshatters -1 damage or fall back and shoot enhancements, hypercrypts’ dimensional overseer allowing you to uppie-downie an extra unit, or even awakened dynasty’s veil of darkness to allow him to uppie-downie once pergame. Every Necron list must include one Hexmark, and should probably have 2.

Flayed Ones are the only unit in the Necron range that come with infiltrate native to their datasheet. They only cost 60 points for a 5-man or 120 for a 10-man, they are oddly tanky at being t4 and having a 4+ armor save while also having stealth. That alone is enough of a reason to stick one unit of these in every list you make, but that’s not all they provide. Their melee profile is quite good at 4 attacks s4 ap1 d1 with both sustained hits 1 and twin-linked, but it’s their ability Flesh Hunger that really sets them over the edge.

:::note[Flesh Hunger]
Each time a model in this unit makes a melee attack, if the target of that attack is below half-strength, a successful Hit roll scores a Critical Hit.
:::

This makes Flayed Ones an amazing tool as an insurance policy when it comes to taking down large models. If a Rhino or Wave Serpent ever peaks and you just need that little extra edge to chip those 2 wounds off, send in 5 Flayed Ones with their sustained hits on 5’s with twin-linked and their make sure the target dies.

Lokhust Destroyers make their way into almost every list, but that’s just because you can take a single 35-point model to run around and do actions. This isn’t to say their stats are bad though – 3 attacks s5 ap2 d2 with lethal hits, with the ability to reroll hits of 1 when shooting the closest target and fully rerolling if that target is on an objective. Pair this with a Lokhust Lord, who gives them Lethal Hits on 5’s, and a 6-man squad of these can be a real nice all-around killing unit. The biggest downside is that the unit does become unwieldy to use on the tabletop – 7 60mm bases that cannot move through walls makes lining the whole squad up on a target difficult, but hey – that’s what detachment rules are for.

Heavy Destroyers are even better. They come with two gun profiles, the first is the single shot flat 6 damage Gauss weapon with lethal hits, and the second Enmitic gun is a 6 shot s6 ap1 d1 blaster that has rapid fire 6 within 18” and sustained hits 1. They both have heavy and they both get to reroll wound rolls of 1 when shooting at their preferred target (Gauss gun at monsters and vehicles, Enmitic gun at everything else).

The Lokhust Lord and lead both of these units, and provides them with critical hits on 5+, an optional resurrection orb, and a solid melee profile that can help clear away any chaff that may charge your unit to tangle them up.

And Finally, Ophydian Destroyers are a pretty decent scoring piece. They have native deep strike, move 10”, and their ability lets them uppie-dowie at the end of your opponents turn. This makes them perfect action monkeys to snake out and score secondaries while your main forces push up the board. They also have access to the once-per-game dev wounds the Skorpekhs have, and they are OC2, which means you could also send a 3-man forward as an early game trade-piece to clear out any light infantry your opponent may have placed on an objective and deny some primary points for a turn.

All of those data sheets sound really nice, right? Sure, there is no ‘centerpiece’ in the range, but if your playstyle leans towards running lots of MSU units that fan out across the board, pop out and break something, and die the next turn, then Annihilation Legion should be the detachment for you! Right?

…Right?

You should never run any of these datasheets in AL, because they would be better served in other detachments.

Let’s go over the rules AL grants the user, so we can get an understanding of why I say this. The detachment rule reads:

## Da Rules

:::important[Annihilation Protocol]
Each time a Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones unit from your army declares a charge, you can re-roll the charge roll. If one or more targets of the charge are Below Half Strength, add 1 to the Charge roll as well.

Each time a Destroyer Cult unit from your army makes a ranged attack that targets the closest eligible target, add 1 to the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack.
:::

Now, I really like the second half of that rule. Setting Enmitic Destroyers up to ap2, Hexmarks and regular Lokhusts to ap3, and Gauss Destroyers to a whopping ap5 is a chunky boost. The rule also has a nice thematic caveat where you need to be shooting the closest target to get the boost. Just think – the Lokhust Destroyers having ensnared their prey, unleash total destruction upon the fetid lifeforms that have infested their galaxy – love it.

What’s this re-roll bullshit? Honestly, who thought this would be something worth making an entire detachment rule for? Lemme explain.

Anyone who has played a melee army already knows how important making a charge is. Making and failing a charge roll is the difference between wiping an enemy unit off the board and doing no damage. Because of this, anyone who has even a modicum of sense is going to stage their units on the board so they can make a charge of 7” or less. This is because any charge at or below 7” is statistically more likely with a 2d6 roll. And even still, you’re going to be packing a CP in reserves because re-rolling a charge roll with the Command Re-roll global stratagem is the most efficient way you could spend CP. All of this is to say that getting to reroll charges as a native ability is cute, but it doesn’t improve the effectiveness of your unit much at all.

And what’s with this “+1 to charge if the targe is nearly dead” bullshit? Setting aside how borked being below half strength is in Warhammer, whose really gonna be chomping at the bit for the tiniest buff to a charge distance if a unit is practically dead? Such a total waste of potential.

But hey, maybe the power of the detachment doesn’t lie in it’s detachment rule. The enhancements gotta be worth taking, right? Really juice up the melee weapons of the characters some? Maybe do something awesome like giving the detachment some damage mitigation tricks? Let’s take a look.

:::note[Soulless Reaper - 20 Pts.]
Destroyer Cult model only. Each time an enemy unit withing Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit is selected to Fall Back, roll one d6: on a 3+ that unit cannot Fall Back this phase and must Remain Stationary
:::

Well this is a neat little toy to stick onto a Skorpekh Lord. Being able to deny an enemy unit from falling back can act as a source of damage mitigation for your fragile Skorpekhs, since infantry units that are engaged cannot be shot. It kinda sucks that there is a 1/3 chance that it just does nothing, but at the 20 point price, it’s fine enough.

:::note[Eldritch Nightmare - 15 Pts.]
Destroyer Cult model only. At the start of the Fight phase, each enemy unit within Engagement Range of the bearer must take a Battle-shock test.
:::

Another just ok enhancement. Battle-shocking is also cute, but it’s also another enhancement that just has a chance of failing and doing nothing. It’s funny that this and Soulless Reaper both stipulate Destroyer Cult models only, when it should really read Skorpekh Lord models only, because you should never be yeeting your Lokhust Lords or Hexmarks – primarily shooting-based units – into melee combat. But hey, again this isn’t a bad enchancement, but it’s not amazing either. Surely the back half will be excellent.

:::note[Eternal Madness - 25 Pts.]
Necrons model only. In the Fight Phase, each time a model in the bearer’s unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a 4+ do not remove the destroyed model from play; it can fight after the attaching model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.
:::

Yikes. Where to start with this one. For one, it’s expensive. 25 points for a coin-flips chance my model gets to fight back is pretty sucky. For two, the units that could make use of this from the Necron range really don’t get a lot of mileage from this effect.

The power of fight on death comes down to what you need to roll to have it take effect. Something like a fight on death on a 2+ is excellent for something like and elite infantry squad. Being able to stage up something like a Skorpekh squad with a 2+ fight on death totally shifts the calculus your opponent needs to think about when they are figuring out what to send to kill that unit. With a 2+, there is a real good chance that whatever they send won’t be coming back, as that squad is going to be able to punch back at 80% power.

Whereas something like a 4+ fight on death is best used in a high model count unit that can punch above it’s weight. A 4+ doesn’t feel so bad when you have a 20-model squad, since you’ll probably still be punching up into whatever charged you. 

So do we got anything like that in the range to fit the bill? It’s worth nothing that this enhancement could go on any Necron character model, so let’s take a look at all the melee-focused options the range has to offer. You got the aforementioned Skorpekh, Wraiths, and Lychguard.

Well, as discussed before, elite melee squads want a more consistent fight on death number, so Skorpekhs and Wraiths are right out since they only come in 6-mans, and Lychguard function more as anvils instead of hammers. Their melee profile is pretty underwhelming, and you don’t play them to kill things but to stand on a point and waste your opponents’ resources. So this enhancement gets a thumbs down from me. Come on last enhancement, save us all from this mediocrity.

:::note[Ingrained Superiority - 10 Pts.]
Necrons model only. Each time a model in the bearer’s ujnit makes an attack, on a Critical Wound, improve the Armour Penetration Characteristic of the attack by 1.
:::

…that’s it? I mean, it’s only 10 points I guess but your wounds have a 1/6 chance to have +1 ap? Whoooooo cares? Where’s the enhancement that supercharges the melee profile of a Skorpekh Lord? Where’s the enhancement that gives a unit something cool like Fights First or access to Heroic Intervention for 0CP? Maybe one that gives a unit the Destroyer Cult Keyword so more units can get tossed into the mix of the detachment?

I guess this one is kinda funny on Heavy Lokhusts and Immortals, since the former can reroll wound rolls of 1 against their weapon’s preferred target and the latter can fully reroll the wound roll if the target is standing on an objective, but we already have a native +1ap if you’re shooting at your closest eligible target!

Well, alrighty – if the detachment rule is a wet fart and the enhancements are just as dog water, that’s gotta mean that there is some nasty sauce lurking in the stratagems. Let’s huff some copium and take a look.

:::tip[Masks of Death - 1CP]
During your opponent’s Shooting Phase or the Fight phase, when your opponent’s unit selects a Destroyer Cult or Flayed one unit, until the end of the phase each time an attack targets your unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
:::

This one is just fine. -1 to hit in both the shooting phase and fight phase is ok damage mitigation. It’s a little annoying that Flayed Ones already get -1 to hit from ranged attacks due to their stealth ability, but hey – that’s a minor overlap. I would have liked to have seen a slightly more significant stat get disrupted, since -1 to hit is probably the weakest stat to modify, but we’ll take what we can get. What else we got?

:::tip[Pitiless Hunters - 1CP]
During the Fight Phase, One Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones unit from your army that has not been selected to fight yet may move 6” instead of 3” when making a Pile-in or Consolidation move
:::

Again, another one that’s just fine. It can crop up from time to time – being able to tag more enemy units in combat that you otherwise wouldn’t be able to, or being able to fall back onto an objective after wiping a squad is nice. Another one I’m not jumping up and down and clapping over, but I’ll take it. Next.

:::tip[The Spoor of Frailty - 1CP]
In your Shooting Phase or the Fight Phase, until the end of the phase whenever your selected Destroyer Cult or Flayed One unit makes and attack that targets a unit below Starting Strength, add 1 to the Hit roll. If the target is Below Half-Strength, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.
:::

I have complex thoughts on this one. One the one hand, only getting access to your damage buff after the enemy unit has either taken damage at all or is close to death stinks. It really makes this stratagem useless under most circumstances since if you were getting access to that +1 to hit AND +1 to wound, you were probably going to kill the thing even without spending the CP.

But.

This stratagem becomes very funny when paired with Flayed Ones Flesh Hunger ability. Doing some quick math using a dice calculator, if you throw 5 Flayed Ones into a big knight who is below half strength, you should expect to deal about 4 wounds. If you juice the Flayed Ones up with the stratagem, so they’d be sustaining on 2s and wounding on 5s with full twin-linked rerolls, it brings your expected damage up to 9 wounds! If you brought a 10-man of Flayed Ones, you’d only need 6 to make it into combat before you are expected to take a big knight at 10 wounds down!
So on the one hand, this stratagem is not good for getting the damage started but can turn a tiny 60-point Flayed One squad into the perfect cleanup machine. Nothing super amaing yet, but nothing terrible either. Next.

:::tip[Murderous Reanimation – 1CP]
During the Fight Phase, when the selected Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones unit from your army has just destroyed an enemy unit or just caused an enemy unit that was not Below Half-Strength to become Below Half-Strength, your unit’s Reanimation Protocols activate.
:::

Eek. Not a good one. Riddle me this, why would I want to bring models back into a unit that is finished attacking? Wouldn’t it be better to reanimate before I’ve attacked with that unit so I can increase the damage a unit will deal? Spending 1CP to bring back d3 Flayed Ones or having a chance to res a Skorpekh model after that unit is finished for the phase is not ideal timing, but every detachment has a stinker stratagem. Two more to go.

:::tip[Blood-fueled Cruelty – 1CP]
During your opponent’s Movement phase, after one of their units ends a Fall back move from one of your Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones units, roll one D6: on a 2-5, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds; on a 6, that enemy unit suffers 3 mortal wounds. Your unit can then make a Normal move, but must end that move as close as possible to that enemy unit.
:::

Yikers, looks like we got two stinkers. For starters, having there be a 1/6 chance you just deal 0 damage is a rough start, but even if you do, you’re only looking at an average of 2 damage for this CP spent. Maybe if the thing falling back unit is just at 1 wound remaining you might pop this, but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.

It also doesn’t help that the second half of this stratagem is no good. Only being able to make a normal move AND needing to end as close as possible is just gifting your opponent the perfect target to shoot or charge. If this allowed you to end withing engagement range it would be excellent, but because you’re forced into a normal move, I’d pass on this one. Last strat – please save us.

:::tip[Insanity’s Ire – 1CP]
During your opponent’s Shooting phase, after an enemy unit has shot at one of your Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones units, if one or more models were destroyed in your unit, you may make a Normal move, but must end that move as close as possible to that enemy unit.
:::

Holy buckets, this is so much worse. It’s a surge move will none of the upsides and all of the downsides. Let’s imagine a scenario where you actually use this strat. Your 6-man Skorpekh brick gets tickled by some enemy firepower and a model dies. You then use this strat, move your 8” into the center of the board, and you’re then lit up by the entire enemy army and in perfect charging distance for your opponent to use your unit as a slingshot into your backlines.

I’m actually having a difficult time seeing a world where these strat doesn’t just help your opponent. I guess maybe in the real late turns of the game, once all the big threats are off the board, if you happen to get plink-shot by something far away this could be handy for some free movement? But everything about this stinks.


## How to de fix this pile of junk?

Now that we’ve read all the rules, square this circle with me. Why would I ever play destroyer cult models in this detachment when they are better served elsewhere? If I wanted to play lots of MSU Skorpekh units, I’m gonna take Awakened Dynasty all day. Getting flat +1 to hit because they are being lead is great, the Hungry Void strat that gives them +1s and +1ap sets their melee profile to s8 ap3 d3 – a chunky difference, I can also give one Skorpekh Lord a 4+ FNP, effectively doubling his wound count, AND I have the Eternal revenant stratagem that lets me stand up a character at the end of the phase. So if you kill a Hexmark or melee my Skorpekh to death, I get to stand those units back up and get free value out of them again.

If I was in love with Lokhust units, why wouldn’t I just play Starshatter? Here’s a list of all the benefits Lokhust models get from being mounted:

- Assault on their guns
- Flat 6” advance
- Move through walls
- +1 to wound when shooting a unit on an objective
- -1 to wound on incoming damage
- Fall back and shoot
- -1 incoming damage
- D6 reactive move when they get shot

This is a mounted lover’s dream toolbox here! I would never trade all of this for only +1ap and conditional +1 to hit and very conditional +1 to wound.

So how do we fix this mess that is Annihilation Legion? Well, first I think it’s important we first return to the fantasy this detachment is supposed to embody. If we understand the look and feel the army should have, we can then make better decisions on what the rules need to be. The name is Annihilation Legion, the units in the range are all crazed robots whose mind have been contorted into only being driven to kill. They’re only fascination is death, and they lose all sense of tactics and strategy when faced against biological life. This detachment should be kill-focused – this is for the person who doesn’t care about losing their models if it means they can carve a bigger chunk out of the enemy’s forces. This is for your Reinhart mains, your Scandinavian players, your Red-Deck-Wins enjoyers. Alright, let’s see how we can match that fantasy with rules that reinforce it.

## Da Fixes

:::important[Revised – Annihilation Protocol]
Each time a Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones unit from your army is selected to fight, if that unit made a Charge move this turn, until the end of the phase, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic and Strength of melee weapons equipped by models in that unit 

Each time a Destroyer Cult unit from your army makes a ranged attack that targets the closest eligible target, add 1 to the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack.
:::

Finally, a solid damage buff, something the detachment about killing is missing. This is a rule seen in other armies – Berserker Warband from World Eaters and Liberator Assault Group from Blood Angels – and it’s a real solid boost. This is the kind of rule that would push me into wanting to run Skorpekhs here instead on in Awakened Dynasty, and the math pans out too! A fully juiced up Skorpekh squad outputs about the same damage from both detachments’ buffs now, Flayed Ones became much scarier, and the Skorpekh Lord is a beauty now that he has 5 s11 attacks.

I kept the +1ap bit from before, because as I stated earlier, it’s a decent damage boost with a fun and thematically appropriate condition. Expose your valuable unit but gain a nice damage buff in return – exactly what we are looking for.

:::note[Revised - Eternal Madness – 20 pts]
Lokhust Lord model only. While this model is leading a unit, add 2 to the Movement characteristic of models in the bearer’s unit. In addition, each time a models in the bearer’s unit makes a Normal, Advance, or Fall Back move, it can move horizontally through terrain features.
:::


A little something for the shooty Destroyer Cult models. This detachment as currently written practically ignores half the destroyer cult range that are shooting focused, so we need to put something in here that incentivizes our players to take Lokhust units over just sticking a DDA inside and calling it good. Being able to give a 6-man Lokhust squad or 3-man Heavy Lokhust squad extra movement has done wonders for their maneuverability and strength in places like Starshatter, so we need this in Annihilation Legion too if we are to compete.

Giving flat +2” is a little worse than assault mathematically but is more consistent. Plus the unit now gets to move through terrain features to make up for that fact. This makes the 6-man Lokhust brick a viable take now, since moving that huge footprint 10” and through terrain features lets you line up all your shots and get full value from the unit.

:::note[Revised – Ingrained Superiority – 25 pts.]
Destroyer Cult model only. Once per battle, at the start of the Fight phase, the bearer can use this Enhancement. If it does, unit then end of the phase, model’s in the bearer’s unit have the Fights First ability.
:::

Another core melee trick that the Necron range completely lacks. No seriously, our entire codex does not have access to fights first – ever since Varguard was sent to legends. This is an enhancement idea I pilfered from Blood Angels, but I think it fits here as well. Giving a Skorpekh squad the ability to Heroic Intervention and still getting to fight first once per game is a nasty threat to hold over your opponents but is also lets to cover your armies greatest weakness once per game – getting charged. This is the kind of enhancement that might temp me over giving a Skorpekh Lord a 4+ FNP.

In GW’s defense, this enhancement’s original effect was written before the +1ap when shooting the closest target caveat was added to the detachment rule. But now that extra ap is a core part of the detachment rule, this enhancement’s occasional buff in ap isn’t really needed anymore.

:::tip[Revised – was Murderous Reanimation, is now Murderous Frenzy – 1CP]
One Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones unit. In the Fight Phase, each time a model in the bearer’s unit is destroyed, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a 3+ do not remove the destroyed model from play; it can fight after the attaching model’s unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.
:::

Murderous reanimation was not only bad as a stratagem but also clashes with the fantasy we want. We don’t want our units to be standing back up and replenishing their forces, we want them to smash like a freight train into the enemy’s backlines and die as quickly as they kill.

Taking fight on death from the enhancement and making it a strat also lets this target Flayed Ones, making a 10-man brick of the little buggers a much more attractive package when you can expect 6-7 of them to fight. Moving the deck to a 3+ also makes using this on Skorpekhs a little spicier, Since Skorpekhs come in 3 and 6-man packages you now expect 2 out of every 3 to fight on death instead of the current 1-2 models.

:::tip[Revised - Insanity’s Ire – 1CP]
During your opponent’s Shooting phase, after an enemy unit has shot at one of your Destroyer Cult or Flayed Ones units, if one or more models were destroyed in your unit, you may make a Surge move. Roll a D6: your unit can be moved a distance in inches up to the result, but it must end that move as close as possible to the closest enemy unit (excluding Aircraft). When doing so, models in your unit can be moved within Engagement Range of enemy units.
:::

Boom. The simplest fix to this stratagem, just make it a proper surge move. To be fair to GW. The idea of having a surge move was not a concept that had made its way across the game yet, but we now live in a world where armies like sisters have access to this powerful tool. Having the random aspect of your movement keeps this strat in check but also provides a degree of uncertainty that your opponent must weigh when choosing whether or not they want to try to take a few models out from your Flayed Ones or Skorpekh squads.

## Please copy my homework James Workshop

And there you have it, if I were to be crowned James Workshop tomorrow, those are the changes I’d make. We now have easy access to a solid and consistent damage buff with he extra strength and damage on the charge; our Lokhust units are a little more attractive now that a squad can gain assault; we got access to once-per-game fights first allowing the player to place a Skorpekh brick further up the board with less fear that they’ll all die for nothing; the fight on death has been moved to a 3+ and is now a strat, which allows Flayed Ones to benefit instead of only Skorpekhs; and the reactive move is now a proper surge move, making it a proper tool for pushing the advantage instead of perfectly presenting a unit for your opponent to light up with shooting and then charge.

This doesn’t fix everything with the detachment – the Eldritch Nightmare enhancement is more cute than useful and the Blood-fueled Cruelty strat still stands on the more niche side, but every detachment has their share of rules that are more for fun’s sake instead of being strictly competitive useful. But hey, now we have real reasons for wanting to run Destroyer Cult units in this detachment instead of using them where the rules are better.
