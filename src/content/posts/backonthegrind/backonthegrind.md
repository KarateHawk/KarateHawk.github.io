# 40k is a game about board control, where capturing pieces is the means to that end. Chess is a game about capturing pieces, and uses board control as a means to that end.

Over the last summer, I’ve found myself in a rut. My job search is essentially dead-on-the-vine, nary a nibble since I graduated from GVSU in April, I’m working a part-time job being a good little wagie shopper at Target, my chess elo slumped back down to the mid 1,200’s and was showing no signs of improving, and I hadn’t painted or moved a 40k model in months.

This all changed about two weeks ago. As mentioned before, I graduated college and moved out from my college town of Allendale, Michigan to my hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan. However, the LGS I used to frequent had posted a notice that a 40k event was gonna be held on the first Saturday of the month. This got me interested, because I hadn’t got the chance to say goodbye to many of the people there, and it would be a good send-off since the place was only 2 hours away.

As you might have seen from my previous posts, I’m a bit of a Necron enjoyer, but recent balance changes and the general lethality of the game had changed so much that a highly defensive playstyle wasn’t nearly as viable as it had been in data slates past. So I thought to myself:
“Y’know… if I’m gonna play some 40k again, let’s make it fresh. I’ve been sitting on a World Eaters army for a solid year now, treating it like an expensive wine I’m saving for just the right moment. Why not try that out instead? They just got a new codex that looks really fun to play.”
And there it started. Went to my new LGS here in Ann Arbor to pick up some holes in my collection, got back on the painting horse and synthwave-ified the crap out of my angry fellers, and had a newly kitted 2k points list ready for the tabletop.

I went 1-2.

Got smacked around by sisters, came within an inch of beating some knights, and barely squeaked out a win against custodes. That last one mostly came from his grav-tank rolling 3 1’s and a 2 to hit my forge fiend. Needless to say, I got smoked.

But something was different this time. There was this strange clarity within me after the event was over. Normally when I lose, I’m lost in this dense fog of “Why?”s where I feel confused or lost as to what I could have done better. This time, my mistakes were obvious, and my path to a victory next time was visible. 
I’ve felt this before. Only a couple times though, after I leave a competitive hobby for a while and come back. I feel like my mind is lighter, like the weight of all previous preconceptions I had about how to play are gone and I get to look at the problems opponents present in a new way.

After returning from the tournament, I knew what this meant. My drive, my competitive spirit was back. And it wanted to win. I dove straight back into chess, and my elo has skyrocketed to a stable 1400, a number I only ever peaked my head into a couple times before. I’ve been grinding 40k games over tabletop simulator with one of those buddy’s from Grand Rapids, and I’ve felt the steady improvement over our games. Each one I come a little closer to winning. I even threw out the list the guy had made for me and wrote one of my own to find my own path. And this all came to a head when I took my list to a local tournament and went 3-0.

Now, granted, the competition out here on the east side of the state is MUCH softer than that of the west side. But this time I felt different. Instead of feeling afraid and agonizing over which hot-shot I’m going to face in the next round, this time I felt like I was the hot-shot. That I was going to be the dread imposed on my opponents.

I could point to a few specific elements that have made me a better chess/40k player. Like analyzing the relative power of pieces based on their position on the board instead of only ever thinking about the given static values they hold. Or coming to enjoy sacrificing pieces if it leads to a better position. But at its roots, I’m simply having fun again. I’m enjoying the process of playing, learning, and bettering my game plans.

This is where that starting sentence came from. I was mulling over why I began improving so fast, and I made the connection while my mind was wondering in the shower. In chess, capturing the king means the game is over. The sole objective is to take a piece away from your opponent. In 40k, it’s to control objectives on the board and score secondary points through performing actions. This places board presence and area control as the methods of determining a winner.

But both of these are tabletop strategy games, they both use those concepts as ways to understand how to play. But I started to break-through when I began crossing the internal wires in my head. 
“Sending in these eight bound out to kill 10 termagants, while a massive waste of points, swings the potential score of the game by 10vp! It’s kinda like sending a knight into a pawn with the expectation that, after the knight is recaptured, the position becomes favorable to me.”

Or thinking:
“Hey, if I set up this long capture chain, at the end we both will come out equal in points but my opponent will have doubled pawns on the edge of the board while my pawn structure remains solid. That’s a lot like sending out my chaos spawn  to pull aggro onto the edge of the board. Those units my opponent will have left over there will be too far away to be useful, and will be heavily wounded to I’ll be able to easily pick them up later.

Something interesting to think about. Maybe you’ll find something similar if you return to a game you’ve put to pasture a while ago. I got another tournament coming up this Saturday in Holland, I’ll let you know how it goes. I’m excited!
