Most of it is world eater good stuff. 3 chaos spawn to run out early and score objectives, clear screen, and sticky objectives on death. A rhino carrying 10 zerkers lead by the MoE and kharn would push up into a good staging point and fire out to take some real pieces off the board. One daemon prince with -1 damage to give out -1cp captain abilities and be a counter-punching threat. One unit of eightbound to give the prince lone-op and hand out an aura of +1 to hit. Two forgefiends to be anti-everything gun platforms. Some jakhals to sticky my home objective and screen. And finally, there’s the helbrute: a cheeky 120 point model that yes, does have the potential to bayblade through an enemy backfield with his “You hit me, I hit you” rule, I’ve mostly used as a counter-punch tool that’s almost garenteed to clear off whatever is holding a point for my opponent since he essentially gets two rounds of fighting with the ability. It also helps that the fact that he COULD tear open an entire backfield alone forces my opponents to spend mental cycles thinking about hwo to deal with him.

That leaves the last section: the 20 zerkers being led by the lord on juggernaut.

I decided to include this centerpiece for a couple of reasons. For one, prior to using these I was running two 10-mans squads in two rhinos. One had kharn, and another had the MoE. It was a fine list, totally playable, but I found that I’d often be better served keeping one rhino back towards my home objective and using it as a shield to keep my kharn unit safe and provide +3” to move, since you get those extra inches when disembarking. It always felt like a waste of points to me, just having a rhino dinking around at home, and I had a brainwave while stocking the shelves of my local Target. The lord of juggernaut gives his unit +2” to their move. That’s pretty damn close to 3” most of the time. He’s also got this neat rule that allows him to move through walls… and give his unit an engagement range of 3” when in combat.

“Hey, that would make a 20-man squad hit real hard, wouldn’t it?” I thought.

And the list was born. Trimmed out some other models to stick the squad in. Found myself some extra points to give the jug lord the re-roll enhancement, and we’re now in business!
Here’s the problem I found with this list: there are no deepstrikers. This is a problem for two reason – First: your opponenet doesn’t need to spend any time screening their backfield. In these most recent games I played, I had to leave some resources at home to keep my home secured, but my opponents could push up their entire army into the board because they had no need for screening. This meant that not only am I playing with less of my army up front, but my opponent spends no cycles considering how I may be able to infiltrate. Secondly: I don’t have any ways to rapid ingress effectively. Rapid ingress is probably the best stratagem in the game. Being able to have perfect information on your opponents board state opens up a huge box tools. There’s the odvious, rapid ingress in your opponents backfield to get a good charge next turn, but there’s also setting up heroic interventions in key places, there’s stealing objectives from armies that rely of sticky effects to hold objectives, and at the very least it forces your opponent to spend attention considering how you’ll throw a wrench into their plans – and attention in a resource like cp and units, getting your opponent to spend too much of it is good.
So I started to peruse through what I had access to with deepstrike. There’s not much. There’s exalted eightbound, but they are more expensive eightbound with a meh melee profile and a terrible ability – pass.
There are chaos terminators, but those guys are even more expensive at 185 points, but they don’t do nearly as much work for that cost – no thank you.
There’s Angron. In his current state? No.
There’s the daemon prince on wings. Even worse, no thanks.
I was getting ready to pack it up and try to find another path forward, but I noticed there’s a certain epic hero who happens to have deepstrike. Lord Invocatus. Not only does he have deepstrike, but he give deepstrike to the unit he’s leading. Oh, and by the way, he can lead berserkers. And hey, he’s only a 5 point difference from the lord I was running before, and I have exactly 5 points to spare.

And that’s where my mind is now – break the 20-man into two 10-mans, and have 3 squads being lead by Kharn, the MoE, and Invo. Stick either the MoE or Kharn into the rhino to push up the board while the other stays back as a counter-punch threat, and send the final squad into the air with Invo to fill that deepstriking threat I’ve been missing.

Is this any better? Does this improve my odds at the table? I need more data before I can give you a solid answer. But for now this is what I’m going to be throwing at Will’s sisters of silence list to gather data.
